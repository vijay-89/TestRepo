The COBRA implementation documents will be sent to you for electronic signature through AdobeSign.


The following forms require completion:

· Notice of Qualifying Event Form (Only Applicable if there are recently termed members that need to be offered COBRA)

After all signatures have been obtained, the executed documents will be provided from EchoSign to everyone copied on this email. Once the COBRA Implementation Coordinator, Carrie Poehls, receives the completed signed documents, she will submit for the group set-up to begin.


Please feel free to contact Carrie with any questions at BCBSGA-COBRA-IMPLEMENTATIONS@Anthem.com .
