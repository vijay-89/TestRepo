Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I will use email templates like this one to make you aware of the various products and services that we are currently offering as well as which of those I feel will best benefit you. I can also use this type of email for correspondence around managing your relationship such as updating your financials, address, or just wishing you a happy birthday.

Having a marketing approved template at my disposal will help me standardize my message while also branding appropriately.

Thanks,

{!Contact.OwnerFullName}</textOnly>
