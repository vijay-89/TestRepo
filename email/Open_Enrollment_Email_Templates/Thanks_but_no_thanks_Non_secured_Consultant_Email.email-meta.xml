    <textOnly>Hello {!SFDC_Volunteer_Participant__c.OE_Ambassador_Volunteer__c}!

Thank you for volunteering to attend this event, {!SFDC_Volunteer_Event__c.Name}.

Currently, I am unable to secure you as the facilitator due to the reason below:

If something should change, and I can use your assistance, I will reach out to check your availability.

Please continue to review the remainder of the meetings in your area. We truly appreciate your support!
