Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I will use email templates like this one to make you aware of the need to provide to us things like financial statements or updated insurance policies.

Personal Financial Statement

This statement does not need to be audited by a CPA.

Annual Tax Returns

Please send your most recently filed returns for all entities with which you are associated.



Having a compliant, consistent message will help me measure and manage response rates to covenants and send out friendly reminders to my customers and clients.

Thanks,

{!Contact.OwnerFirstName}</textOnly>
